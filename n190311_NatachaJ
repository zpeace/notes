Recent advances in AI and machine learning by Natacha Jaques

deep learning is the answer to ImageNet

"smiling women" - "women" + "men" = "smiling men"
"king" - "man" + "woman" = "queen"magenet

GAN: generative adversarial networks

2015, fake living room. fake face generated. 2018 fake any image.

deep reinforcement learning for data center cooling. reduce energy cost by 10%.

learning thorugh social awareness
recurrent neural network. used in natural language processing. predict next word. If used for smart robot, can be very boring.
Sketch RNN: GAN + VAE: RL to learn to draw using feedback. can work with small amount of data.

creative AI: model to learn music to create music. 

health: predict person's mood tomorrow, personalized machine learning (more like segmented...)
traditional learning has bad performance

generate possible drug molecle form
